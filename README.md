1. CONCLUSION

This is a proposal for the technical strategy of the Deximus project in meeting its goal for creating a Decentralize Exchange (DEX) for facilitation of inter-blockchain asset exchange and trading as a core foundational component of a broad multi-blockchain ecosystem for the backbone of the “Internet Of Value”.

The DEX is without a doubt a challenging and very rewarding project to undertake. This proposal will attempt to show how to best leverage technology in achieving the maximum returns for technical investment.

## Opportunity
The full potential of a multi-asset blockchain protocol is a common standard for synchronization of asset transfers between different blockchains, and between different consensus mechanisms and asset types.

The reason for this is that all non-essential components to both the financial relationships in the ledger, and for the technical function of the system, are potential barriers and friction. The approach of this proposal gives both the lowest barrier to technical achievement in terms of scope, while also creating technical innovation and compounding the reduced friction of bringing a more standardized protocol to the marketplace.

This method of value transfer between blockchains is commonly referred to in its technical function as a “Decentralized Exchange” or DEX.

## Value Proposition
A DEX makes possible the synchronization of the transfer of value between multiple ledgers using a standard protocol in place of centralized authority. The open operation of such an exchange platform creates tremendous potential for low barrier to entry asset exchange, a major competitive advantage to legacy international exchange.

Decentralized Exchange Key Features
1. Multi-ledger value transfer synchronization through “hub” blockchain
1. Audit trail of reconciled trades
1. Currency agnostic transactions for payments
1. Autonomous operation
1. Global scalability
1. All permissioned (POS) blockchain benefits

## Market Timing
The business model of Deximus deployment services addresses the market opportunity for the real world business applications of a decentralized exchange. The convergence of these opportunities demonstrates a strong disruptive potential in the market acceptance of blockchain technology.

**Summary**

1. Opportunity gap: Lack of consensus and leadership around a multi-blockchain standard.
1. Timing: Evolution of multi-blockchain technology (HyperLedger, Cosmos, etc.)
1. Timing: Market demand for more blockchains/ICO’s
Monetization

Clearly the opportunity to monetize any blockchain platform, and a DEX presents both unique opportunities and challenges. It is important to maximize monetization for investment returns, but also to eliminate gaps which competition may later more easily otherwise fill.

## Digital Property
In the formation of any permissioned decentralized blockchain protocol, special privileges and responsibilities are declared at the instantiation of the ledger to a set of public keys. The first consensus reached by the system is the consensus of the validator/gateway nodes on which other validator/gateway nodes they will recognize in the operation of the consensus protocol on the state of the ledger.

Specifically, this will allow the Deximus partner to hold incredibly valuable assets as digital properties by controlling the private keys to these access privileges in the protocol. As will the partners in the consensus and as is consistent with “Proof of Stake” consensus mechanisms.

## Revenues
As is consistent with POS blockchains, transaction validators/gateways are able to generate revenue, for both security and incentive purposes. It is important to realize that fees may not be limited to merely transactions in the base credit units, but also in derivative or secondary assets and smart contracts operated within the system.
Access Sales & Partnerships
All value and monetization which Deximus services can realize, Senator’s partners will be able to realize in leveraging the platform in the issuance of their own blockchain based digital assets into a ready made marketplace.

Deximus platforms will be able to either charge for access for these partner blockchains to it’s co-dependent decentralized exchange, or potentially receive digital asset or tokens in a swap of value in the associated blockchains, or even in their operational and access privileges.
Fundraising
It should be noted that the DEX hub blockchain itself might end up having only  a limited function token, or no token at all. This will be necessary to facilitate the true market function of asset pair exchange, without additional value flux in the system introduced by the existence of an intermediary or even operational value measure.
Technology
Requirements
These are the areas of technology domain required to satisfy architectural and strategic requirments:

1.	Blockchain architecture
2.	Research
3.	Security
4.	Development
5.	Testing
6.	Deployment
7.	Integrations
8.	Distribution

The technical requirements of both personnel and infrastructure comprise nearly the full development stack of the blockchain ecosystem.
Existing Technology
Leveraging an existing technology platform that meets the requirments of the decentralized exchange architecture briefly outlined here, then there should be minimal requirements on low level compiled languages (correlating to the necessity of core transaction protocol modifications), and will mostly rely on scripting languages and technology for creating the smart-contracts and custom management software or payment apps.

Existing technology that may be used could include:
* Cosmos
* Hyper Ledger
* Open Bankit
* Etc…

## Architecture
The proposed architecture of the Decenentralized exchange codenamed “Deximus”, will be a modification of the initial concepts developed by the Cosmos project in their description of a conceptual overview, with a few modificatinos.

Instead of focusing on the ability to transmit “packets” of information between blockchains, we take the financial approach as primary, as it is what defines relationships and transactions in the blockchain application specific to Deximus.

## Components
It is proposed to attempt to implement the following:

1. Protocol level order book operation in mempool
1. Recording of the reconciliation in trades in the blockchain ledgers of both the exchange hub and corresponding blockchain asset ledgers.
1. Protocol level accounts for operation of market making mechanisms in asset blockchains and exchange hub order matching
1. Standardized account addressing format for ease of recognition and operation of paired accounts transactions across multiple ledgers, sharing same originating keysets (HDW).

## Schedule
The desired outcome for the development of the technology is such that a working prototype that proves the capability of the system is demonstrable going into a crowd or public funding round.

The full process through architecture, team building, research, and through to deployment is estimated to take approximately 1 year. At this preliminary stage it is hard to estimate what impact any major changes or pivots in strategy will have on the schedule, however this should be sufficient time to manage minor changes in project or product development.

## Conclusion
This strategic and architectural proposal for the application for blockchain technology in accordance with Deximus partner business model shows an optimized approach to meeting the matching market and technical opportunity. The timing is right for seizing market-share in the now proven blockchain technology space and markets.

The technology at the core of this proposal represents the attempt at creating one of the “Holy Grails” of blockchain technology, and regardless of the degree of success in this direction, even modified existing standards can facilitate the intended function of the system to match with Deximus partner’s business model.

DEX is cool.

The branding potential is a positive aspect to the technology, and should not be underestimated.

Lastly, and mostly importantly, having core team members of the business and technical side of a startup whose necessarily different visions coincide such as that between Deximus partners and the Deximus architecture, lead to the potential for great team synergy.
